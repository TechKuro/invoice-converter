# Field-Level Encryption Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up field-level encryption for the PDF Invoice Converter application.

## Overview

Your application now supports **AES-256 field-level encryption** using the `cryptography` library, which provides:
- ‚úÖ **Selective field encryption** - Only sensitive data is encrypted
- ‚úÖ **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without build tools
- ‚úÖ **Transparent operation** - No changes to your workflow
- ‚úÖ **Easy installation** - No compiler dependencies required
- ‚úÖ **Strong security** - Military-grade AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation

## Quick Setup

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the setup script to automatically install and configure encryption:

```bash
python setup_encryption.py
```

This script will:
- Install cryptography library dependencies
- Generate secure encryption keys and salt
- Initialize field-level encryption
- Test the encryption setup

### Step 2: Run Your Application

After setup, run your application normally:

```bash
# Desktop Application
python desktop_app/main.py
# or
streamlit run desktop_app/main.py

# Batch Script
run_desktop_app.bat
```

## Manual Installation (If Needed)

If the automatic setup fails, install dependencies manually:

### All Platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
```bash
# Install cryptography library (has pre-built wheels)
pip install cryptography>=3.4.0
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** No build tools or compilers required! The cryptography library provides pre-built wheels for all major platforms.

## Security Features

### What's Encrypted
- ‚úÖ Invoice data (numbers, dates, amounts)
- ‚úÖ Line items (descriptions, quantities, prices)
- ‚úÖ User accounts and authentication
- ‚úÖ Processing history and file metadata
- ‚úÖ All database content

### What's Protected
- üîê **Encrypted Fields**: Invoice data, line items, file names, email addresses
- üîë **Encryption key**: `.field_encryption_key` (256-bit key material)
- üßÇ **Salt file**: `.encryption_salt` (16-byte random salt)
- üìÅ **File permissions**: Restricted access (Unix/Linux)
- üö´ **Version control**: Key files automatically excluded via .gitignore

## Important Security Notes

### üö® CRITICAL: Backup Your Encryption Files

**Two files are essential for accessing your encrypted data:**

- **Key file**: `desktop_app/.field_encryption_key` (64-character hex string)
- **Salt file**: `desktop_app/.encryption_salt` (binary salt data)
- **Backup**: Copy both files to secure location immediately
- **Recovery**: If either file is lost, your encrypted data cannot be recovered

### Key Management Best Practices

1. **Immediate Backup**
   ```bash
   # Copy both encryption files to a secure location
   cp desktop_app/.field_encryption_key /path/to/secure/backup/location/
   cp desktop_app/.encryption_salt /path/to/secure/backup/location/
   ```

2. **Multiple Backups**
   - Local encrypted storage
   - Secure cloud storage (encrypted)
   - Physical secure location

3. **Access Control**
   - Never share the key file
   - Don't commit to version control (already in .gitignore)
   - Restrict file permissions

## Encryption Initialization

### First Run Setup

When you first run the application with encryption:
1. Encryption key and salt files are automatically generated
2. New data is automatically encrypted when stored
3. Existing unencrypted data remains readable
4. Gradual migration occurs as data is accessed and updated

### Setup Status

Check if encryption is working:
- ‚úÖ File exists: `desktop_app/.field_encryption_key`
- ‚úÖ File exists: `desktop_app/.encryption_salt`
- ‚úÖ Application starts without errors
- ‚úÖ New data shows as "ENC:..." in database (encrypted)
- ‚úÖ Data displays normally in application (decrypted)

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Error: "Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required" (Windows)**
```bash
# Download and install Visual Studio Build Tools
# Then retry: pip install pysqlcipher3
```

**Error: "Failed building wheel for pysqlcipher3" (macOS)**
```bash
xcode-select --install
pip install pysqlcipher3
```

**Error: "libsqlcipher-dev not found" (Linux)**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libsqlcipher-dev
pip install pysqlcipher3
```

### Runtime Issues

**Error: "Database is locked"**
- Close all application instances
- Check for background processes
- Restart the application

**Error: "file is not a database"**
- Encryption key might be wrong
- Database file might be corrupted
- Restore from backup if needed

**Error: "no such table: user"**
- Database not initialized
- Run `python setup_encryption.py` again

### Recovery Procedures

**Lost Encryption Key**
- ‚ùå Data cannot be recovered without the key
- ‚úÖ Restore key from backup
- ‚úÖ Start fresh with new database

**Corrupted Database**
- Restore from backup
- Re-run migration if needed
- Check disk space and permissions

## Performance Impact

Database encryption has minimal performance impact:
- **Read operations**: ~2-5% slower
- **Write operations**: ~3-7% slower
- **Memory usage**: +10-20MB
- **File size**: +2-5% larger

For typical invoice processing workloads, this is negligible.

## Testing Encryption

Verify encryption is working:

```python
# This should fail with wrong key
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('desktop_app/pdf_converter_encrypted.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM user")  # Should raise DatabaseError
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check this guide's troubleshooting section
2. Verify all dependencies are installed
3. Ensure you have proper permissions
4. Backup your key file before making changes

**Remember**: Your encryption key is irreplaceable. Back it up immediately after setup!
